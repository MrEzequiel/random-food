              Wash and peel the potatoes and cut into similarly sized pieces for
              even cooking. In a large soup pot, boil the potatoes and the bay
              leaves in salted water for 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. If
              you're not using a bag of ready-cut curly kale, wash the bunches
              thoroughly under cool running water to get rid of all soilâ€”you
              wouldn't want that gritty texture in your finished dish. Trim any
              coarse stems and discard any brown leaves. With a sharp knife, cut
              the curly kale into thin strips. Peel and chop the shallots. In a
              frying pan or skillet, melt 1 tbsp. of butter and saute the
              shallots for a few minutes before adding the curly kale and 2
              tbsp. of water. Season and cook for about 10 minutes, or until
              tender. Warm the milk on the stove or in the microwave. Drain,
              shake and dry the potatoes with kitchen towels before mashing with
              a potato masher or ricer. Working quickly, add the warm milk and
              the remaining butter. Season to taste with nutmeg, salt, and
              pepper. Mix the cooked curly kale through the cooked mashed potato
              mixture. Top with slices of the smoked sausage and serve hot with
              your favorite mustard or gravy. Serve and enjoy!"
